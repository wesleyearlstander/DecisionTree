# DecisionTree

Python Implementation of decision tree and random forest for discrete and continuous input.

The input dataset was a set of letters of different fonts with gaussian distortion added.

Dataset used allowed for input to be considered as continuous or discrete.
Both implementations were used and used with varying sizes of random forests.

The continuous implementation achieved the highest accuracies. The splits were the amount of decision trees in the random forest. The highest accuracy occurred with only 1 split, hence the random forest implementations were not needed for this dataset but may work better on larger datasets.
